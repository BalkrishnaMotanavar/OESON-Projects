# Drowsiness Detection - EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis on smart wearable data (Galaxy Watch 4) including Heart Rate and PPG sensors. Goal: understand indicators of drowsiness using Karolinska Sleepiness Scale.

## 🔍 Focus Areas
- Signal trends vs Drowsiness Level (0 to 2)
- Outlier behavior in PPG and Heart Rate signals

## 🔧 Tools
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📌 Key Insights
- Heart Rate inversely correlated with drowsiness
- PPG signals showed high variability, less useful standalone
