# Olympic Medal Prediction

Developed regression and deep learning models to predict the number of medals won by countries using factors such as GDP, population, and sports infrastructure.

## ðŸ§  Models Used
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Decision Trees & Random Forests
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

## ðŸ”§ Tools
- Python
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow

## ðŸ“Œ Key Findings
- GDP had an 83% correlation with medal counts.
- ANN with 3 hidden layers and tuned hyperparameters gave best performance.
